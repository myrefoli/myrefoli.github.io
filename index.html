				<h1>Kaitlin Hsu</h1>

				<div id = "content">

					<p>I am an undergraduate student studying computer science (with an emphasis on bioinformatics) and English at Stanford University. Broadly, I'm interested in backend engineering—from building APIs and software architecture, to even how institutions teach these technological concepts.</p>
					
					<p>As the <a href="https://stanfordssi.org/teams/biology">Biology Team</a> Co-Lead for Stanford Student Space Initiative (SSI), I've done research about enzymatic DNA synthesis and protein crystallography. I’ve also worked on computational projects involving RNA sequencing and protein folding simulations.</p>

					<p>In my free time, I write and make art. Here you can find any of my upcoming and past exhibits, published writings, and various thoughts on the world.</p>

					<p> My email address is khsu22@stanford.edu.</p>

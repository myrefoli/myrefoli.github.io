				<h1>Kaitlin Hsu</h1>

				<div id = "content">

					<p>I am an undergraduate student studying computer science (with an emphasis on bioinformatics) and English at Stanford University. Broadly, I'm interested in the applications of computer science in the biochemical world and beyondâ€”RNA sequencing, protein folding simulations, even how we teach these scientific and technological concepts.
</p>
					
					<p> As the <a href="https://stanfordssi.org/teams/biology">Biology Team</a> Co-Lead for Stanford Student Space Initiative (SSI), I've done research about enzymatic DNA synthesis and protein crystallography. I also write and make art.</p>

					<p> Here you can find any of my upcoming and past exhibits, published writings, and various thoughts on the world. </p>

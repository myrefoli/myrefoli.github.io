					<p>i am a queer taiwanese poet and translator from the bay area. i recently graduated from stanford university where i studied english (poetry) & computer science (biocomputation). <!-- Broadly, I'm interested in backend engineering—from building APIs and software architecture, to even how institutions teach these technological concepts. --> through the <a href="https://arts.stanford.edu/for-students/academics/honors-in-the-arts/" target="_blank">honors in the arts</a> program, i wrote a zine of persona poems.</p> 

					<p>some things i'm thinking about: making crosswords, literature in translation, organizing & negative capability.</p>

					

					<!--
					<p>i like constructing xwords that wax poetic, fail the turing test & make my friends laugh. check them out here!</p>

					<p>as the <a href="https://stanfordssi.org/teams/biology" target="_blank">Biology Team</a> Co-Lead for Stanford Student Space Initiative (SSI), I've worked on computational projects like RNA sequencing and protein folding simulations.

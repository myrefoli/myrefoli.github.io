					<p>I contribute to <a href="http://www.fountainhopper.com/" target="_blank">The Fountain Hopper</a>, home to Stanford's best (and at times very snarky) investigative reporting. I've also taken a few creative writing courses (one in prose and one in poetry). I wrote a lot before college, partly because I was the editor-in-chief of my high school's newspaper, partly because I just loved it (and still do!) as a form of expression.</p>
